This project will use Zillow's data to estimate the home value prediction errors. The project is to help Zillow identify and minimize Mean Absolute Error between the predicted log error (predicted error by the project) and the actual log error (Zillowâ€™s prediction error). The output will help Zillow to identify and reduce prediction errors, and provide more accurate home value estimation.
